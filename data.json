    "review_reason": "The ad contains several issues. Firstly, the stated mileage of 300 kms for a 2024 model is highly improbable and suggests a misleading claim. Secondly, the description claims 'brand new condition' despite only 300 kms driven, which is a significant mismatch. Thirdly, the phrase 'as good as a fresh delivery' is an exaggeration. While the ad includes many positive attributes (sunroof, service history), the mileage significantly undermines the credibility of the 'brand new' claim. The combination of these factors warrants rejection."

    "review_reason": "The ad contains several issues. Firstly, the mileage is stated as 300 kms for a 2024 model, which is highly improbable and suggests a misleading claim. Secondly, the description claims ‘Brand New Condition’ despite only 300 kms driven. Thirdly, the claim of ‘no accidents’ without verifiable documentation is a common misrepresentation. The description also uses overly enthusiastic sales language ('as good as a fresh delivery') which is generally discouraged. Finally, the year (2024) and mileage (50000) are a significant mismatch, indicating potential fraudulent activity.  The 'Brand New Condition' claim needs further investigation."

    "status": "reject",
    "review_reason": "The ad contains several red flags. The claim '1st owner only 2-3 piece minor touchp own engine' is highly suspect and likely an exaggeration.  Stating 'suspenion 100' (presumably meaning suspension is perfect) is an unverifiable claim.  'Just buy n drive' is a sales pitch and while not inherently problematic, combined with the other claims, raises concerns.  Furthermore, the description doesn't fully align with the provided brand (Toyota), model (Corolla), and variant (GLI). The mileage of 52k is potentially inconsistent with a 2019 model; a 2019 Corolla with 52k miles is unusual.  The language is also vague and potentially misleading.  I require more specific and verifiable information before approving this ad."
